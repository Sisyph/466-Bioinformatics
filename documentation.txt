Assignment 2, Problem 3
Permutation-based tests of significance

Implement a program that:
	  a. reads a Fasta file and counts the number of occurences of a given word in the DNA sequence (denoted by N)
	  b. permutes the given sequence 1000 times and counts the occurrences of the same work in each of those permutations
	  c. calculates the "p-value" of N, i.e., the fraction of times that the ovserved count in the permuted sequences was as large or larger than N
	  d. prints the length of the sequence, the count N, and the p-value of N

The program should be run as: 
<programfilename> <FastaFilename> <word>
The input word will be of length <= 10
